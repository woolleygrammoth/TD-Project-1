        <main>
            I've been thinking recently that I've had a lot of crazy experiences in my short 
            quarter-century (ish) on Earth. They come in different categories, so here they are.

                <h2>Growing up</h2>
                <p>
                    My parents divorced when I was 3. They had wildly different worldviews,
                    so it's crazy that they were ever together long enough to have 4 children
                    (I am the youngest of those). <em>more stuff later</em>

                <h2>School</h2>
                <p>
                    I grew up in a Chicago suburban neighborhood where movies like <em>The Breakfast Club</em>
                    and <em>Mean Girls</em> are based. The high school I went to was incredibly competitive. I 
                    was one of maybe five students out of 1200 in my class that didn't go directly to some 
                    prestigious, brand name school. Instead, I went to Community College. <em>more stuff later</em>
