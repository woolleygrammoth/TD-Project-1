        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The  most important things in my life are my dog (Jenga, pictured above), my family,
          my music (I love to play the guitar and other instruments), and the wonderful nature around me. 
          I studied physics at UC Berkeley and now I teach STEM at ARISE High School in the Fruitvale area of Oakland. 
          I love being a teacher because watching students grow and learn over time is so rewarding. As a STEM teacher, 
          I never lose the novelty in anything because the students are constantly re-discovering it in front of me. 
          
        </p>
        <p>More than anything else, I care deeply about the environment and about this planet that we all inhabit. 
           I'm gravely concerned about climate change and want to do something about it. That's why, in a couple years, 
           I'll be applying to PhD programs to study battery science. Batteries are the only piece of the climate puzzle that 
           haven't been figured out yet. I want to find a material that can replace lithium in our batteries so that they'll be 
           sustainable long into the future. 
        </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>One goal of mine is to help all of my students finish their Techdegrees. I'm just a couple weeks ahead of them 
          and I want to motivate them to succeed. In the process, I'll also learn a lot about web development! I'm excited. 
        </p>
        <p>I also have a list of miscellaneous goals involving my health and skills: 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Get better at the guitar</li>
          <li>Exercise regularly (6/7 days)</li>
          <li>Master my sleep habits</li>
          <li>Get a PhD in Materials Science & Engineering</li>
          <li>Make a website about climate change</li>
          <li>Keep my precious doggo happy</li>
        </ul>
